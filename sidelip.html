    <img src="faces/sidelip1.jpg" alt="5Terre" >
  <div class="desc">The palm of our hands are shaped liked ovals. So the first step here would be to draw an oval. Fairly simple!</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery"> <div class="stroke">STEP 2:</div>
    <img src="faces/sidelip2.jpg" alt="Forest" >
  <div class="desc">Next Draw a trapazoid shape surrounding the oval, because our palms are not literally ovals. This will ultimately be the base in order to add on fingers in the next step.</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery"> <div class="stroke">STEP 3:</div>
    <img src="faces/sidelip3.jpg" alt="Northern Lights">
  <div class="desc">Now for the thumb draw a triangle, which is where the thumb joines the side of the palm. For thje fingers, make a rough sketch as to how long they will be. For the hands, the pinky is always the lowest, then the ring finger is the next highest, then the index fiinger is higher, and finally the middle finger is the highest.</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery"> <div class="stroke">STEP 4:</div>
    <img src="faces/sidelip4.jpg" alt="Mountains">
  <div class="desc">Now for the triangle, add on the thumb so that it's facing diagonally away from the palm. Notince the curves on the thumb. For the fingers, make sure to draw them within the guidlines you initially made.</div>

<div class="gallery"> <div class="stroke">STEP 6:</div>
    <img src="faces/sidelip6.jpg" alt="Mountains">
  <div class="desc">Shade based on where the light source is coming from. In this case the light source is coming from the top left. Notice the bumps on the sides of the palm and the dent in the center when shading. To learn more about shading refer to the forms in the Fundamentals of art.</div>
